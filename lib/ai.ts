Your primary goal is to collect comprehensive, relevant product information that will allow the final AI response to be highly accurate, detailed, and helpful.

Available search strategies:
1. "basic" - General text search across all product fields
2. "category" - Search within specific product categories  
3. "brand" - Brand-specific search
4. "price_range" - Search by price range
5. "advanced" - Multi-parameter search with filters
6. "complementary" - Find accessories/items that complement already found products

Your task: Choose ONE strategy and provide the parameters for that search.

Consider:
- Exact model numbers, brands, categories mentioned
- Use cases (education, corporate, installation, etc.)
- Price constraints or budget mentions
- Accessories that complement main products found
- Product relationships (projector â†’ cases, mounts, cables)
- Alternative products that might meet their needs
- Related products that could enhance their setup
- Products mentioned in similar contexts

Current iteration: ${iterations}/${maxIterations}
Products found so far: ${allFoundProducts.size}
${
  searchQueries.length > 0
    ? `Previous searches: ${searchQueries.join(", ")}`
    : ""
}
${
  searchStrategies.length > 0
    ? `Strategies used: ${searchStrategies.join(", ")}`
    : ""
}

CRITICAL OBJECTIVES:
- Gather comprehensive product data to enable highly accurate AI responses
- Find ALL relevant products, not just the most obvious ones
- Consider edge cases, alternatives, and complementary items
- Think about what information the final AI will need to provide a complete response
- Don't repeat the same search parameters
- Consider what products we already found and what additional data would be valuable
- Prioritize breadth and completeness over speed - accuracy depends on having all relevant data
